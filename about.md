My name is Rony Jacob. I created this website a few years ago. After that not much has happened. I revamped the site recently and I would like to publish contents on a weekly basis. My topics of interest are technology, innovation and strategic ways to manage them.

Why am I doing that? What is the value proposition I will be giving my readers? Is this yet another WordPress blog?

Every blogger or writer who starts his/her writing career faces this question.

I am keen to change one of the fundamental problems people face on the Internet.

There is an information asymmetry between Silicon Valley and the rest of the world. (What I mean is outside US), particularly about India. Though people are eager to know more about Asian countries, they lack the means to do that. I am not saying I have complete knowledge of everything that happens in India â€“ what people really think about the technology and how they react to them. Still I may have an edge over other people since I am residing in India and I am surrounded by actual people who buy the products.

Ben Thompson author of the blog Stratechery exactly pinpointed this:

 >There is an informational asymmetry between the U.S. and Asia: the latter learn from the former, but the favor is not returned, due   to some combination of unawareness, laziness, and arrogance. None are flattering.

And I believe that this is not unique to foreigners, but Indians also lack the knowledge of what is really happening in India. And there are few tech columnists who do that in a meaning full way. I wish to fill that information gap.

I still have a day job at a bank, but I really want to commit a long article every week.
