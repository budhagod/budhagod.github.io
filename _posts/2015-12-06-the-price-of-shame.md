We are hearing a lot about cyber-bulling these days . Monica may be the first person who was the victim of cyber bulling. She talks about her horrible experience she had those early days of 1998.  This is an old video, I have found it on the YouTube.

What this video made me realize that you don't need a social network to get cyber-bullied. Anonymous nature of internet gives people real power of doing bulling against people. They invade individual privacy and tarnish  their reputation.Sadly most people even don't know what they are doing is wrong.
