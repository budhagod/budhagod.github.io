<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/28/the-windows-10-era-is-now/#.onziww:VCiQ">The Windows 10 Era Is Now</a>
<blockquote>At some point inside the next 24 hours, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/product/windows-10" target="_blank">Window 10</a> will “launch” in New Zealand, before spreading out across the globe. To a certain extent. Of course, for the more than 5 million folks currently testing the software, its “launch” is almost a non-event.</blockquote>
I am very much excited to use it  after reading the fantastic review by Tom Warren on <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/28/9045331/microsoft-windows-10-review">Thverge</a>. In his own words :
<blockquote>Windows 10 is hugely exciting. I rarely touch my MacBook Air anymore as I find the combination of some good hardware (like the Dell XPS 13) and Windows 10 is a joy to use. I like the direction Microsoft is taking with Windows 10, accepting feedback and ideas from its customers along the way. It feels like the best way to shape Windows into something people enjoy using, rather than something they have to use.</blockquote>
