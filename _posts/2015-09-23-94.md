<a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf">Reflection on Trusting Trust</a>

Ben Thompson:
<blockquote>I was so bummed that I didn't reference Unix creator Ken Thompson's Turing Award lecture entitled <a class="" href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf" target="_blank">Reflections on Trusting Trust</a> in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/malware-hits-ios-the-importance-of-the-app-store-xcodeghost-what-happened-and-what-now/" target="_blank">yesterday's update</a>. The entire premise is about how a compiler can introduce undiscoverable trojan horses in a program (well, more precisely, how each level of abstraction can introduce undiscoverable trojan horses in the level above it). It's not an exact match for what happened with Xcode, but it's in the ball park, and the broad takeaway is that you can never trust code that you did not totally create yourself; it goes without saying you can't trust code from an intermediary.</blockquote>
