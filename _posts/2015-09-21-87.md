Important problem is malicious apps were able to bypass the Apple review process and legitimately get into the app store. The review process which may takes many week to complete had completely failed in this case. Also it can affect the user outside China if users download these apps. It is one of the biggest malware attack as around 500 million people were affected.  Android Play is much safer than iOS App store  now.
