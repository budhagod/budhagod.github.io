From this month on words I will publish a blog post about my goal of current month and achievements I had in the previous month.I believe that this will help me to achieve  what I want to achieve in my life. Also sharing with public makes  you feel embarrassed when you don't do things timely manner. And that helps to stick with your goals.

You may have guessed correctly, why  I am doing this is because I am bad at keeping my goals and promises (not to others!) .That made me curious, if I am good at fulfilling  promises with other people why I cant't be good at fulfilling my own goals. So this is the way I choose to motivate and compel myself to keep my promises.

I don't have a template for this review and hope that it will evolve over a period of time.

Goals:
<ol>
	<li>Complete my fancy project -RSS application MVP</li>
	<li>Write daily and publish once in three days- at least some linked list type article to my blog.</li>
	<li>Read one book in a month</li>
</ol>
