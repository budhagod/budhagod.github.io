<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/28/snowden-pardon/">White House Dismisses Petition For Edward Snowden’s Pardon</a>
<blockquote>Today, the White House responded to and dismissed a nearly two-year-old petition asking for the pardon of Edward Snowden, and cited that his decision to “steal and disclose classified information had severe consequences for the security of our country and the people who work day in and day out to protect it.

If he felt his actions were consistent with civil disobedience,” Monaco said, “then he should do what those who have taken issue with their own government do: Challenge it, speak out, engage in a constructive act of protest, and — importantly — accept the consequences of his actions. He should come home to the United States, and be judged by a jury of his peers — not hide behind the cover of an authoritarian regime. Right now, he’s running away from the consequences of his actions</blockquote>
Bingo. A country that advocates  free speech and went for teaching other countries about democracy and openness shows shallowness in their thought and act when  they need to show the world what it is.
