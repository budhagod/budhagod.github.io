<blockquote>According to anonymous industry sources, <a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/tag/samsung/" target="_blank">Samsung</a> is preparing to mass produce its Exynos 8890 chip in time for the launch of the <a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/tag/samsung-galaxy-s7" target="_blank">Galaxy S7</a>. Interestingly, the SoC is said to feature a custom CPU core designed by Samsung itself.

Apparently, the custom core is known as the M1. We don’t have any specific details about the CPU, but it will surely be based on the ARMv8 architecture, just like custom processors designed by Apple and Qualcomm’s upcoming Kryo CPU. The Exynos 8890 will be mass produced at Samsung’s Giheung plant starting December, at the latest.</blockquote>
For Samsung it is important for them to have a growing  semiconductor as its smartphone division hits the roof. Also it helps them improve its profitability.
