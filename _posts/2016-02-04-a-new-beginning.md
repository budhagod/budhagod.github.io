It has been a while I have written something here. Life changed a lot after that small post published here.  I really thanks all of you who spend their time to stop here and read whatever I wrote here. Thank you guys!

My life has been changed since I met Annet(now my wife). We met each other through a matrimony site and  We got married last month ( Jan 25 2016).

<a href="http://www.ronyjacob.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_3432.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-208"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-208" src="http://www.ronyjacob.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_3432-1024x683.jpg" alt="Annet Wedding" width="720" height="480" /></a>

Life has been wonderful since then.

Annet is a food technologist and she had been working in a local food company before marriage. She is a perfectionist and hard worker. I am really proud of her.

I am in a transition period. There is a thrill in changing from 'I' to 'We'. Also there are some occasional difficulties. Life nowadays is a little more busy and I am a little afraid that will create large gaps in my posting schedule. Nevertheless,I am planning to continue my writings here with much more frequency. I hope I can succeed in this challenge.

So cheers Guys have nice day !
