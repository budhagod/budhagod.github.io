Congratulation Paul. It is a great achievement. He wrote  a wonderful reminisce post about thrilling journey he took. It is inspirational but frightening too, especially when he says personal blog is dead
<blockquote>I used to follow hundreds of fellow bloggers and get greeted by a packed RSS reader every morning. But that's no more; they've all stopped blogging. The only blogs that remain are large, commercial multi-author websites — the BuzzFeed, HuffPo and their ilk — which we don't call blogs anymore.

The era of the personal website is over. It's now just a personal landing page with a photo, bio and link to a Twitter profile.</blockquote>
