Since Amazon announced Kindle unlimited in India, I have been planing to purchase it for Rs:99 for the first month. By which I can access around one million titles across various categories.

For year I have been a vivid reader. I mainly read blogs and newspaper on the internet. So there are not much books - some of the must read in my credit. And one the typical problem with  me reading books is that some of them are really outdated and worth no use to readers( specially in case of computer books in which I am particularly interested.) . Apart form that almost all thing about books are better than blogs  and newspaper columns.

There are two-three benefits from Kindle unlimited over normal book purchases. First one is that you can available more than one million books and you can read any book from the available pool. There is no risk of buying a non useful book and feeling guilty about it.

Secondly it force me also others in some way to read books with in a time frame. Currently I am planning to test it for one month as I want to check whether I can commit my time to justify the cost of it and am I getting benefits from it. There is an important covet as in Kindle unlimited you are not owning any books and you just get them on a lease .

Third point I want to make is that there is a lot of Indian writers books are available on   this plan like Chetan Bagat ,Amish Tripathi etc.

Also other benefits of Kindle - You can access it on any devices no need of a dedicated  device,  No need to worry about keeping books . One of the main problem I have found is that there is no much local language books are available (it is not available in kindle book store too) on Kindle unlimited which may disheartening for many people.

Anyway I am quite impressed with Kindle unlimited and  hopping for a long relationship with service:

Also I am planning to write a review about it after one month using it.
