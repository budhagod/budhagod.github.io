<a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/sony-buy-toshiba-image-sensor-division-651481/">Sony might buy Toshiba image sensor division and expand its camera empire</a>
<blockquote>Sony has been a main supplier of camera sensors for manufacturers like <a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/tag/apple/">Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/tag/samsung/">Samsung</a>,<a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/tag/xiaomi/">Xiaomi</a>, <a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/tag/motorola/">Motorola</a> and others. You have heard the word “Exmor” being thrown around, right? Yeah, Sony’s cameras are all over the smartphone business, but plans for expansions don’t seem to be ending where they currently are.

According to “sources with knowledge of the deal”, Sony and <a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/tag/toshiba/">Toshiba</a> are getting ready to sign a deal for 20 billion Yen (close to $165 million USD). If all goes smoothly, this would make Sony the owner of Toshiba’s image sensor division, which would include the plant in Oita, Southern Japan. Toshiba would then pull out of this business and look for greener pastures in other markets.</blockquote>
Sony has been considered as the best image sensor manufacture in the world and used by many companies like Apple, Samsung etc. If this deal happen it will strengthen the position of sony
