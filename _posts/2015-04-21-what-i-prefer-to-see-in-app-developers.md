<span style="font-family: inherit;">My last post was about why I buy apps. So I think, it is better to  to explain about what I prefer to see in App developers.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">Last year I bought an app called Press, it was a RSS reader. Since I read a lot, that was one of the first things I did when I bought a new phone. It was a nice, feature rich app and it was hailed as “The best RSS reader for android.” In the first use itself I fall in love with the app. But later on, problems were started creeping in.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">After some time of use, the app apparently stops working. The feeds fetch was not working properly. I thought the developer would fix it in their future updates. But even until now there is no update available.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">I have been checking the play store time to time for its updates. What I now feel is that the developer has cheated me, as they abandoned the product.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">So the first important thing I do before I buy any app is to check the frequency of their updates – whether the developer listens to his users and is he willing to fix the bugs.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">We buy apps and products because of different reasons and preferences. But how do we feel if the company or developer is not providing the support to its customers when they face issues? So I believe the foremost point for a developer to be successful is to have consistency in answering the queries from their customers.</span>
