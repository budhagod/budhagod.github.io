<a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.in/2015/10/indonesia-loon-internet.html">Bringing the Internet within reach of 100 million Indonesians</a>
<blockquote>In Indonesia today, only about 1 out of every 3 people are connected to the web, and most of their connections are painfully slow. Many people live in areas without existing Internet infrastructure; on an archipelago of over 17,000 islands, with mountains and jungles, it’s difficult to run fiber optic cable or install mobile phone towers. That’s where Loon comes in. Loon balloons act like floating cell phone towers in the sky. Flying on the winds at altitudes twice as high as commercial planes, each one beams a connection down to the ground; as one balloon drifts out of range, another moves in to take its place. We hope this could help local operators extend the coverage of their existing networks, and reach further into rural and remote areas.</blockquote>
One of the main problem with internet service providers is that they can't cover all the geographic area due to various reasons like forests, lower population density etc. In those areas also people are living or traveling to . Project loon is a excellent and capable enough to meet their demands.
