<span style="font-family: inherit;">Last week I had a conversation with one of my coworker and he was implying that his phone was not loud enough. He is using a Micromax Canvas Gold I guess, not too sure about it. His way around ‘this shortcoming’ was to install poweramp app, which amplifies the sound.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">But the app is not free – users can install and try it for a month. So I asked to him to buy that if he finds it useful. But his answer was astonishing. He said that he is never going to buy it but will re install the app every time it expires.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">I tried to reason with him, why he should buy the app and how it will be a help to the developer. But I failed and he hasn’t agreed to any of my arguments.
These were my arguments.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">First of all, l buy apps if I feel it worthy of buying. It will be a help to developer as he is spending countless number of hours to modify and improve his apps.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">Most of the people don’t see any difference between paid apps and free apps. Yes, some free apps are much better than their paid counter parts. But in general paid apps are better than free apps as they tend to have more features and are more polished than the free ones.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">If a developer gets paid, he will definitely try to improve his apps which in turn will improve the overall efficiency of the app ecosystem. More number of developers will come into the platform and develop more applications, which is again good for the users. Thus both, the customer and the developer will benefit.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">Sadly most users are not bothered about this. To them buying an app is a waste of money. I think users will buy apps only if they tried to develop atleast one app in their lifetime.</span>
