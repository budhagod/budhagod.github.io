<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/06/samsung-2q2015-guidance/"><span style="color: #e8554e;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Techcrunch</span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> reports  about Samsung Q2 earnings.</span></span>
<blockquote><span style="color: #9c9c9c;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The company said today that its Q2 2015 earnings will likely miss expectations. Its operating profit is expected to be 6.9 trillion won (about $6.13 billion), a four percent decline from a year ago, and below analysts’ expectations for 7.2 trillion won. Consolidated sales slipped eight percent to 48 trillion won, below forecasts for 53 trillion won.</span></span></span></blockquote>
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Yes it is very disappointing to see Samsung is failing even when they have option to be successful.  Supply side issues has undermined the technical achievement they had with Galaxy Edge. And they failed to fulfill the demand for its well reviewed flagship phone.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: x-large;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Basic problem happened to Samsung is that they under estimated the market for the Galaxy Edge.  Most of their marketing was concentrated on Galaxy S6 rather than Edge. They forget the fact that Edge is superior phone than Galaxy S6 .  And people who likely to buy a high end phone will buy the best in the category . They wont buy normal Galaxy S6 for the sake of saving $100</span></span></span>
