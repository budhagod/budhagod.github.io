Mark Bergen writing for  Recode:
<blockquote>It’s Google’s turn now. The Alphabet company is getting ready to open a dedicated home for podcasts on its Google Play hub. Today the company is <a class="external" href="http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/2015/10/podcasters-welcome-to-google-play-music.html">letting podcast creators upload shows</a> to Google Play Music, its streaming service; it says listeners will be able to listen to those shows “in the coming months.” It will be, remarkably, the first native app for podcast listening on Android in the content market where Apple carries disproportionate weight.</blockquote>
I have an affinity towards podcasts  for the past several years. Most of the time it is difficult for me to discover new podcasts on Android as there is no service equivalent to iTunes. Now that is almost over. With next a few months I can open Google play app and find   new podcasts.

Moreover a giant like Google is entering and competing with Apple is good for podcast industry and podcast lovers.
