There are two kinds of people on the earth who takes photos on every occasion and those who won’t. I am in the second category of people whom would like to enjoy the events, trips or anything without being hindered by taking photos. Also this habit was developed in me by interacting with people who were attending meeting and trips so that they could show up their heads on every photographs. I had met these kind of people when I was studying college and those were a hindrance to natural progress of the events and trips.

So naturally I went to the opposite extreme . I didn’t take photos even if necessary . I own a Sony DSLR which was gathering dust in my room. I haven’t clicked any photographs in recent months.

It is easy for me to justify that I can have these memories in my brain. Yes some experience I had with these trips cannot be recreated with any photos. But as I grow my memory will start lose its sharpness and  my memories will fade away.

I just don't want that happen to me.

Both these two extremes are not good. First category people cannot enjoy the trips and events to maximum level and second category of people who also misses some kind of nostalgic feeling when you come across an old photo of yours which might pop up a memory of a good trip you had with your friends.

I some time feel sorry about that I didn't s take photos of trips and events I had in the past. So I am going to take photos of important moments in my life. I am neither going to be first nor second kind extreme. I just want to be normal person whom would really like to take photos and tell the stories to his grandchildren about the story behind the photographs.
