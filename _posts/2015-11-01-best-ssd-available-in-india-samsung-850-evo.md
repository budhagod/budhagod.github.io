<strong>Introduction</strong>

It has been one and half months since I upgraded my laptop hard disk with a new Samsung 850 EVO SSD. My initial urge was to write a review about the performance of my new SSD, how was it working then and whether I was satisfied with its performance. But I thought it was a good idea if I wait for some time and use the product for one month or so that I can have enough experience to write a complete review .

So the occasion has come and this is my verdict.

Am I satisfied with the new Samsung 850 EVO SSD ?

Yes I am. before installing the new SSD my Asus laptop will take around 1.5min to 2 min to boot. But now it would do it in less than 20 seconds to boot and around 15 sec to shutdown. if you are using a newer version of windows like Windows 8 and Windows 10 it would be twice as fast as what I am currently getting.

<strong>Why?</strong>

Last June I had finally started noticing that my laptop had some problem . My laptop went considerably slow after using it for ten or fifteen minutes. I didn't sure about what was the exact reason behind this problem. Might be a hard disk problem or even a motherboard problem. Also I was a little confused whether I should replace my laptop all together or replace the parts that caused the problem.

Finally I figured out my hard disk caused all these sort of problem. Moreover I feared the worst consequence of the problem- it would sink with all my data - all of them which I had spent years to collect.

My initial urge was to dispose my laptop all together and to buy a new mac book air. But as I was not swimming in cash it would take nearly my two month salary just for buying it.

So I searched for other options like buying a mac min and setup a desktop computer. But fortunately I didn't buy that as it was a cumbersome process that includes a lot of way a rounds like using a connector for connecting Mac mini to traditional PC monitor.
Even if I had done that it would have cost me around Rs 45k. So I decided to replace my hard disk.

<strong>Harddisk or SSD</strong>

I was confused whether I should buy a spinning hard disk or SSD(solid state drive). Each of them have their on merits and demerits. Spinning hard disks are cheaper and also have high capacity but less writing and reading speed. On other hand SSDs are faster compared to spinning ones but costlier in nature. I want more speed and performance than capacity so I decided to buy SSD instead of spinning hard disk.

Reviewing site Wirecutter says "Much more importantly, SSDs have super fast random-access times. Random access measures the amount of time it takes for a drive to access a random bit of data on the drive. A mechanical hard drive has to physically move a magnetic head to a specific part of a rotating disk to read the data. This takes around 17 ms on a fast mechanical drive. An SSD can do that in less than 0.1 ms. That speed adds up." This can boost the performance of the computers.

Also one of the important bottle neck in performance of PCs and laptops is a spinning hard disk. If any one wants to improve his laptops performance, first thing he can do is replacing the hard disk with a SSD followed by increasing its memory.

<strong>Which one?</strong>

Ok I was decided to buy SSD, but there was one question was left behind - which one I was going to buy as there are many SSDs out in the market. If you u go through the e commerce sites like Amazon and Flipkart, you would find recommendations from many people who have bought SSD from the sites and these are highly valuable to as I didn't know anybody in person who actually bought a SSD. And I went through these comments and other reviewing sites several time and I decided to purchase Samsung SSD 850 EVO.

I bought Samsung SSD 850 EVO from Snapdeal. It was `the costliest 120GB SSD out there but have a lot of goodness - 5 year warranty , best in class performance and more importantly have much less customer complaints about the product( from what I saw). As a user I am satisfied with its performance and I am really like to recommend this product to any one who wish to upgrade his/her hard disk.

Some important things which make Samsung 850 EVO SSD stand apart from competitor's SSDS

1. Unlike other SSD manufactures Samsung makes everything its own including SSD controllers which makes Samsung SSDs work as a single unit compared to other SSDs.

2. As AnandTech says, “A single NAND die isn’t very fast but when you put a dozen or more of them in parallel, the performance adds up.” If your drive has fewer modules than your controller can write to at once (i.e. if you have a lower capacity), it won’t be as fast as it could be. With today’s SSDs, you’ll get the best speeds from 500GB or 1TB drives. Smaller drives often have slower write speeds, roughly scaling with the number of NAND modules on board. The 850 EVO mostly escapes this thanks to its TurboWrite feature, but higher-capacity versions are still faster in heavy workloads.

3. Don't worry even if you want to buy a small drive like what I did . Thanks to Samsung's Turbo write technology which uses a small portion of high speed flash storage and caches all incoming write operations fires there before writing them to the drive. This is much more important when you use small drives like 120GB or 256 GB as 500GB and 1 TB have enough NAND to create parallelization.

4.One thing makes Samsung SSD 850 EVO best among the options is that Samsung offers five years warranty for its SSD products. No other competitor is currently offering a five year warranty for SSDs.

If you are not a kind of person like me who would like to have a external hard disk for saving hie media files, you may need higher capacity hard drive. But in my case I didn't want to spend too much of money on hard disk. I have an external hard disk of capacity 1 TB where I store all of media files. Also I am planning to convert my old internal hard disk which I replaced with SSD to a portable hard drive.

I ordered item on Snapdeal and it took around one week to get it on my hand.

<strong>Installing</strong>

Installing was the simplest part of the all process. You need to take a back up of your files and softwares if you need them in future. I copied all of my data to my external Toshiba hard disk.You can use a backuping software if you like I removed a couple of screws at the bottom of laptop/ back side and removed the small steel hard disk mounter and insert the SSD.

Then I freshly installed Windows 7 in my laptop and copied back important files I need in day to day task.

<strong>Performance</strong>

I am satisfied with its performance as I am currently using a entry level Asus windows machine with 2GB ram and I am getting a performance par to the higher end laptops. So far I haven't come across any problem with my drive.

Some important tips to remember.

Don't Defrag. Defragmentation is a process by which operating system reallocate the files together so that it can reduce the seek time -time which hard disk read/write head takes to locate the position of the file. Since in solid sate hard drives there is no rotating arm, it treat every storage location same. A NAND gates life is counted by how much time it is used so it is better to keep it away from additional works as well.
