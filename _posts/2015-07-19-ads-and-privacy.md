<del></del><span style="font-family: inherit;">Last week there was a huge debate on the web over privacy and advertising. Apple’s new privacy extension which was released with iOS 9, kick started the debate and so many articles were written about the pros and cons of the current state of advertising and level of privacy we have. Most of these articles were pointing fingers (fair warning: These are Apple centric sites) at Google and other publishers for breaching privacy of online users. Though I agree with some points they raised, I disagree with most of them. If you haven’t read those articles yet l can wait for you. These are the links.</span><a href="http://www.imore.com/content-blockers-bad-ads-and-what-were-doing-about-it"><span style="color: #e8554e;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">link1</span></span></a><span style="font-family: inherit;"> </span><a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2945007/private-i-firefox-and-others-deal-with-unwanted-trackers-whether-ads-or-malicious.html"><span style="color: #e8554e;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">link2</span></span></a>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">I have found that there are many people who use ad blockers to prevent ads being served when they are visiting websites. While in certain scenarios it is advisable to use an extension to prevent annoying ads, in general it is not morally correct since we are conveniently ignoring the fact that these site are hung up on advertising for their income. If there is no income these sites are not going to be viable. If you do not like a site because of its ads, don’t go there. Go somewhere else and read something else. When you go there, and read what they have put up when using an adblocker it is stealing. And that is piracy.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">There is a difference between free content and content with ads even though both cost you nothing. Literally speaking, one has ads and other one doesn’t. But in reality both belong to different classes of creators. Ad based sites are probably more sustainable and create more regular content than non-ad based ones. Non-ad based sites are more likely run by amateurs and may not have a regular writing schedule. (Some caveats applicable here is, not every website follows this rule). In today’s world, ads are essential for longer running of these sites.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">So why would anyone directly market ads, rather than relying on Adwords and other programs? It is really hard for a site like Mobilenation to monetize through direct selling of ads. Even Twitter, with all of its massive audiences, has faced a lot of problems in direct monetization.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">The next possible option is subscriptions. A Rene Ritchie pointed out, “historically, subscription based model doesn’t work with large sites.” Moreover I know only a few persons who are capable of doing it and are making a sustainable income from it. May be a Ben Thompson can do that, or Nytimes or Wallstreet Journal or theinformation can do that. But how many Ben Thompsons do I really need as a reader? I need several of them. A handful of sites cannot generate or report all the stories around the world. Even if I subscribed all the above said sites, there is no guarantee that they will report all the new stories. There may be instances when a new site is breaking an untold story. What will I do then? Go and subscribe them, right? But then how much will my advertising budget be?</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">Yet another popular opinion is, ads are okay but don’t track us! It is very hard to argue against this but ads will become useless if they don’t track people. If, when I visit a site it shows some ad exclusive to America then is it of any use to me when I am residing in India? Both the user and the advertiser have no use with these ads.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">Again there is an argument that the user doesn’t need to think about the business model of the site they visit consume content. When there is no effective monetization they will not be sustainable in the long run. In future, sites that are capable of generating money from the audience will be much less. Lesser number of sites means there will lesser good and differentiated content for the user. Ultimately it will affect the readers only.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">I am not undermining the fact that ads need to improve. Like in the case of multiple ads running in the same page, there is no need for multiple trackers for each ad slots. Using one ad tracker for all ads will reduce the loading time, thus improving the user experience. It is hard to ignore ads on mobile websites and the chances of accidental clicks are high. This is something that needs to be changed.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">The part played by Apple need not be interpreted in favor of users only. It is also a weapon made against Google to reduce the income they are getting from the Apple users. May be it is good for Apple to see Google losing some money but ultimately it is a war against the long survival of the internet.</span>
