The new option, called Evernote Plus, allows users to upload up to 1GB of notes monthly and unlocks offline access to notes on mobile devices, passcode lock, and a feature that lets you turn emails into notes. The new package will run you $2.99 a month or $24.99 per year.</span></span></blockquote>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Finally Evernote became more affordable to vast majority of people. For years I have been using it. Till now I havn’t had a need for the paid version. Even though now I am considering to upgrade to its paid plan.</span>
