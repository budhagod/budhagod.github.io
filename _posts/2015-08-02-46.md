<blockquote>In a blog post on Thursday, the U.S. company said it believed no one country should have the authority to control what content someone in a second country can access.

Google warned that applying the right to be forgotten globally would trigger a “race to the bottom” where “the Internet would only be as free as the world’s least free place.”</blockquote>
There are two basic problems which contradicting each other. First problem is  If that rule was globally applied, it would leave us no information at all.  Consider a scenario where Snowden's  leaks were asked to remove by American Gov, we would be in situation where we can't  know more about NSA's snooping operations. This leads to countries to not allow to show up any negative links about them in the search results.

Second problem is it is easy for people to circumvent and  access a blocked information by switching between one Google domain to another.(ex: from Google.de to Google.fr)

What can Google do is the switching between these domain should be much more difficult than what we have right now.
