<a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/android-one-marshmallow-update-647254/">Marshmallow landing on 1st gen Android One phones</a>

Rob Triggs reports for Androidauthority.
<blockquote>The time has come for Android 6.0 Marshmallow to finally start rolling out to Nexus devices and it seems that a number of first generation Android One smartphones are also receiving the speedy update treatment.

Android One Marshmallow update notificationWe have been told that Android 6.0 updates have been spotted for the Micromax Canvas A1 and Myphone Uno so far, and files for the rest of the series are probably on the way too. The update has already landed on devices in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, so keep your eyes open for an OTA update in the coming days.</blockquote>
It is nice to see that Google is considering Android one as a part of its important strategy. Google want to set an example for other OEMs out there to follow the its foot steps and create a good customer experience by providing updates frequently .
