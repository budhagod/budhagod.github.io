<a href="http://https://brooksreview.net/2015/08/touchy/">Macbook as New Computer Class</a>

<blockquote>Do you remember Netbooks? What about Ultrabooks? (They might even still use that name.) There’s also “convertibles”. “2-n-1s”. Or a dozen other names — my point being that when manufacturers other than Apple release a radical new hardware type for a computer, they tended to pay some marketing type gobs of money to name that computer class.

 Clearly you use this piece of shit only for surfing the web, and since eMachine is taken, let’s go with Netbook. Ta-da.

The thing is, Apple never really played that game. They name the computers, but not the computer class, so with Apple it is just Desktop and Notebook

PC manufacturers have priducts at every price point in contrast to Apple which have handful of products. And also there is some kind of classification in the Apple's product line up. Apple have Air , Retina and iMac series. But it is not as visible as other PC manufacturers.
