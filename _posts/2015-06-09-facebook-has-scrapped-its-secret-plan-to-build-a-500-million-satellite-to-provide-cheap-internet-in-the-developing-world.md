<span style="font-family: inherit;">Due to recent back sashes happened to them over Internet.org, I don’t believe they are as committed to subsidized internet service as earlier.  Using our own satellites is very high capital intensive program and there are a lot of technical challenges to solve . Also I am sure that $500 million is only the initial investment amount needed and they need more money in the long run.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">Basic idea of the project is to provide a constellation of satellites to cover larger area and provide faster internet.</span>

<blockquote><span style="color: #9c9c9c;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">While Facebook’s cancelled project comes from the more traditional approach to satellite internet, the current hope of Wyler and other satellite entrepreneurs is that constellations made up of many small satellites could solve those two problems. They would offer faster service, since they are closer to earth than the typical communication satellites, which fly at high altitudes to maximize coverage; and they would cost less, since tiny satellites are typically less expensive than their larger siblings.</span></span></blockquote>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Facebook makes money from advertising. These kind of companies need growing user base for sustainable business. As you reach more people you can show them more ads and make more money. Since Facebook growth is stagnated in the developed countries they need more presence in developing countries. We know the problem with the developing countries is  that they  lack infrastructure. Facebook can add another one billion people by tapping the untapped potential of developing countries. For that they need to provide the basic infrastructure.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">Safest way in which now Facebook can do this is to use already established services.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">Business Insider reports:</span>
<blockquote><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/Facebook-Dumps-Secret-Plan-to-Build-Satellite?token=83f3613caa51d531f022bcb35492d465"><span style="color: #e8554e;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The Information’s report</span></span></a><span style="color: #9c9c9c;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">, based on “a person with direct knowledge of the project and a person briefed about it,” says it would have been a geostationary satellite that could have helped provide internet access to dozens of countries. Instead, it may now lease a satellite off another provider, if it does decide to push ahead with its plans.</span></span></blockquote>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Facebook is using other options like drones to give internet access in developed world.  I don’t know how much successful is that thing in the long run. But I am skeptical about that.</span>
