<span style="font-family: inherit;">I first heard about net neutrality in 2014, in the midst of a Netflix controversy. At that time I did not have any idea what it was. So I did some research and found what it was and I was able to distinguish between fast lane and slow lane. I am always a supporter of Net neutrality and I believe that it is the first and foremost rule of Internet, the one thing that made Internet a thriving medium for innovation.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">At that time We appreciated the efforts of companies like Twitter, Facebook and others to make internet available for everyone without discrimination.(I wanted to include Google also in the list but I found out that they stand somewhat in favor of anti-net neutrality)</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">Their efforts have succeeded in a ruling from the FCC (Federal Communication Commission) that enforced net neutrality. That is what settled the net neutrality debate in America.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">In India, there is a loud debate going on now about net neutrality.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">From Wikipedia,</span>
<blockquote><span style="color: #9c9c9c;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">In recent times, the debate in India about Net Neutrality has heated up with a large scale online campaign for it, and asking people to get associated with the movement for net neutrality. Major newspapers have reported how ‘fight for net neutrality’ has ‘united internet’. During the last few days, more than 600,000 e-mails and online petitions have been sent to Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) and Union Ministry for Communication and Information Technology ‘to act against the violation of net neutrality by corporate interests’. This online petition is in response to a consultation paper on over-the-top services (OTT) and net neutrality for public feedback released by TRAI.</span></span></blockquote>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Wikipedia is somewhat abrupt and doesn’t talk about the internet.org or Airtel zero. For those who don’t know, internet.org, is a service initiated by Facebook to enable internet access to poor people who haven’t had the luxury of ‘internet’.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">Why is Facebook doing such a benevolent scheme? They want to find their fortune at the bottom of the pyramid. As Facebook growth starts stagnating they want to accelerate it by adding more people to its service. Since they have reached the ceiling in developed countries, they are moving to developing countries like India, Indonesia and other African countries. In order to reach the poor people, Facebook offers free internet. The Internet bundle by the Facebook is just a superset of Facebook and other services – most of them I haven’t even heard off – and it doesn’t have the full access to Internet, just a selection of some services.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">Hindustan Times wrote this about the actual intentions of Internet.org</span>
<blockquote><span style="color: #9c9c9c;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Mr. Zuckerberg’s ambitions become clear when, in his article, he says Internet.org is open to “all mobile operators” and “as many internet providers” as possible. Who does he not mention? Internet sites and mobile apps. Because the power to decide which of them get on Internet.org will rest with Facebook. Internet.org is not open, and despite its name, is not the Internet.</span></span></blockquote>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">I wrote this article to just say one thing, Anti net neutrality movements by telecommunication providers in America and Internet.org, Airtel Zero in India have the same mentality. Lobbyists want to make more profit and they don’t care even if it kills the openness, innovation and accessibility.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">But one question still remains, who will give the poor actual access to The Internet?</span>
